# TO DO

I intend to use this project to improve my coding skills over time so here are some things I would like to improve:

- Dynamic Id generator for the products ( )

- If the quantity is 0, the product should be removed off list ( )

- Search function and filter by name ( )

- Drag and drop function ( )
